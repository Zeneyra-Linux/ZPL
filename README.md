# ZPL
Zeneyra Pulic License

This license is used for most-to-all Zeneyra Linux-related projects as well as my, Stridsvagn69420, personal projects.

## Goals
* Easy to read and hopefully short license terms.
* License or reference to License must be shipped with the product.
* Allow distribution, modification, commercial and private use, perhaps Patent use too.
* Permit usage of this license for your own projects, since there can be a loophole where using a license for your own project can get you into issues.
* Prohibit Warranty and Liability, unless explicitly given by the software vendor.
* State changes, if it's a fork/modified version, and disclose source, even if it's used on a server instead of a person's computer (similar to EUPL/AGPL).
* License and copyright notice, both for the main project and what's it's modified/based on.
* Advertising clause for it as a dependency/part of the project, similar to BSD-4 (especially due to the Fortune 500s) without being painful to fulfill.
